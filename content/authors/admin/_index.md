# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research interests are developing and applying Machine Learning, Data Mining and Statistical methods (e.g., Multi-task Learning, Survival Analysis, Clustering, Risk Factor Analysis and Causal Discovery) on various data including gene expression, electronic health/medical records, and DNA sequencing reads for both cognitive disorders (e.g., delirium, Alzheimer's disease, dementia, major depressive disorder) and chronic diseases (e.g., cancer, obesity, hypertension). Inspired by the human factors approach, she also designs and develops Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence tools for users to integrate, visualize, analyze, and interpret health data in order to improve the interoperability and accessibility of AI-assisted healthcare decision support.
